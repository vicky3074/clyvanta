# CI/CD Troubleshooting Session Summary
**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Issue**: Broken CI/CD pipeline causing deployment failures  
**Status**: Root cause identified, manual intervention required

## üö® Current Status

### Main Problem
**Your application is NOT running on the production server** despite the server being accessible.

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Server is UP**: DigitalOcean droplet is running and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Network connectivity**: GitHub Actions can reach your server
- ‚úÖ **SSH port open**: Port 22 is accessible from GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ **HTTP ports open**: Ports 80 and 8080 are accessible but no application responding
- ‚úÖ **GitHub secrets configured**: DROPLET_IP and SSH_PRIVATE_KEY are set in production environment
- ‚úÖ **Local environment**: Working with `clyvanta-clyvanta-web` image built from source

### What's NOT Working ‚ùå
- ‚ùå **Application not responding**: No web server on ports 80, 8080
- ‚ùå **Domain not working**: https://clyvanta.com returns no response  
- ‚ùå **SSH authentication failing**: CI/CD cannot authenticate to server
- ‚ùå **Docker containers not running**: Application containers are down

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Application Down
**Test Results from GitHub Actions**:
```
‚ùå Server not responding on port 8080
‚ùå Server not responding on port 80  
‚ùå Domain not responding
```

This indicates **Docker containers are not running** on the production server.

### Secondary Issue: SSH Authentication 
**CI/CD fails at SSH step** with timeout, suggesting:
- SSH key mismatch between GitHub secrets and server
- Wrong username (using `ubuntu` but might need `root`)
- SSH configuration changed on server

### Port Conflict Resolution ‚úÖ
**Fixed locally**: The "port 80 already allocated" error was resolved by:
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq) 
docker system prune -f
docker compose up -d --build
```

## üìã Actions Taken This Session

### 1. Identified Port Conflict Issue
- **Problem**: `docker compose up` failed with "port 80 already allocated"
- **Solution**: Cleaned up old containers and rebuilt from source
- **Result**: Local environment now working with source builds

### 2. Rebuilt CI/CD Pipeline
- **Old approach**: Complex 300+ line workflow with over-engineering
- **New approach**: Simple workflows focusing on core deployment
- **Files created**:
  - `deploy-production.yml` - Main deployment workflow
  - `server-connectivity.yml` - Network connectivity testing
  - `ssh-test.yml` - SSH authentication testing  
  - `check-server.yml` - Application status checking

### 3. Diagnosed Network vs Application Issues
- **Network tests**: Server reachable, ports open ‚úÖ
- **Application tests**: No web server responding ‚ùå
- **Conclusion**: Infrastructure is fine, application is down

### 4. Docker Environment Cleanup
- **Removed Docker Hub dependency**: Switched to git-based builds only
- **Local environment**: Now uses `build: .` instead of Docker Hub images
- **Container status**: Running locally with source-built images

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps (PRIORITY)

### 1. Manual Server Recovery (CRITICAL)
**You need to SSH to your production server and restart the application**:

```bash
# Connect to server
ssh ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Check current status  
docker ps
cd clyvanta-new
docker compose ps

# Start application
docker compose up -d --build

# Verify working
curl http://localhost:8080
```

### 2. Fix SSH Authentication 
**After application is running, fix CI/CD SSH issues**:
- Verify SSH key in GitHub secrets matches server
- Test with different username (`root` instead of `ubuntu`)
- Regenerate SSH key if needed

### 3. Test CI/CD Pipeline
**Once app is manually running and SSH is fixed**:
- Make small commit to trigger deployment
- Monitor workflow execution
- Verify deployment succeeds

## üìÅ Current File Status

### Working Files ‚úÖ
- `docker-compose.yml` - Production config using `build: .`
- `docker-compose.8888.yml` - Local SIT environment  
- `Dockerfile` - Application build configuration
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Main deployment workflow

### Test/Debug Files üîß
- `.github/workflows/server-connectivity.yml` - Network testing
- `.github/workflows/ssh-test.yml` - SSH debugging
- `.github/workflows/check-server.yml` - Application status
- `test-server.sh` - Local connectivity testing script

### Removed Files üóëÔ∏è
- `docker-compose.complete.yml` - Unused single-container setup
- `docker-compose.webhook.yml` - Old webhook deployment
- All old/complex CI/CD workflows

## üîê GitHub Configuration

### Secrets (Environment: production)
- ‚úÖ `DROPLET_IP` - Server IP address  
- ‚úÖ `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key for server access
- ‚úÖ `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Docker Hub username (not currently used)
- ‚úÖ `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Docker Hub password (not currently used)

### Workflow Permissions
- Environment protection: `production` environment configured
- Secrets accessible to workflows using `environment: production`

## üöÄ Long-term Improvements

### 1. Robust Deployment Strategy
```yaml
# Enhanced deployment with cleanup
- Stop containers by name (more reliable)
- Clean Docker resources  
- Kill processes using ports 80/8080
- Wait for ports to be available
- Start fresh containers
```

### 2. Better Health Checks
```yaml
# Multi-stage verification
- Container health checks
- HTTP endpoint testing  
- Domain verification
- Rollback on failure
```

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- Application uptime monitoring
- Automated recovery procedures
- Deployment success notifications

## üìû Next Session Priorities

1. **Manually restart production application** (CRITICAL)
2. **Fix SSH authentication** for CI/CD
3. **Test end-to-end deployment** with small commit
4. **Add robust error handling** to deployment workflow
5. **Implement monitoring** to prevent future outages

## üîÑ Session Continuation Commands

```bash
# Check if server is accessible
curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080

# Test SSH connection  
ssh ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Run connectivity test
gh workflow run server-connectivity.yml --repo vicky3074/clyvanta

# Check workflow status
gh run list --repo vicky3074/clyvanta --limit 5

# View specific workflow logs
gh run view RUN_ID --repo vicky3074/clyvanta --log
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Insights

1. **Infrastructure vs Application**: Server was up but application was down
2. **Don't over-engineer**: Simple deployment workflows work better
3. **Test connectivity separately**: Network vs application vs authentication
4. **Manual intervention sometimes needed**: CI/CD can't fix everything
5. **Local environment parity**: Keep local and production environments synchronized

---

**Bottom Line**: Your server is running and accessible, but your application containers are down. Manual restart required before CI/CD will work.
